    The ICC T20 World Cup is the premier international championship of Twenty20
    (T20) cricket, the shortest format of the game, first held in 2007 in South
    Africa. The tournament is organized by the International Cricket Council
    (ICC) and features the top cricketing nations competing in fast-paced
    matches, each team batting for a maximum of 20 overs. Unlike the traditional
    50-over Cricket World Cup, T20 matches are shorter, more dynamic, and often
    produce unpredictable results, making the tournament highly popular among
    fans worldwide. India has had a strong history in the T20 World Cup. In the
    inaugural 2007 edition, India, under MS Dhoni, defeated Pakistan in a
    thrilling final to become the first-ever T20 World Champions. The tournament
    has since been held every few years, with teams like West Indies, England,
    and Australia also winning titles. The T20 World Cup is notable for its
    high-intensity matches, innovative batting, aggressive bowling, and exciting
    fielding, and it has played a major role in popularizing T20 cricket
    globally, influencing the rise of domestic T20 leagues such as the Indian
    Premier League (IPL).
