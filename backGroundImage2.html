    The 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup was the tenth edition of the tournament and
    was co-hosted by India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh from 19 February to 2
    April 2011. India, led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, entered the tournament as
    one of the favorites, having a strong team featuring players like Sachin
    Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, and Zaheer Khan. The tournament
    featured 14 teams divided into two groups, and matches were played across
    multiple venues in the host countries. India progressed steadily through the
    group stage and knockout rounds, showing a mix of aggressive batting,
    disciplined bowling, and strategic fielding. The final match was held on 2
    April 2011 at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai, where India faced Sri Lanka. Sri
    Lanka batted first and set a target of 275 runs, with Mahela Jayawardene
    scoring a brilliant century. India’s chase began cautiously but gained
    momentum with key contributions from Gautam Gambhir (97 runs) and a
    memorable 91 not out from Dhoni, who sealed the victory with a six, bringing
    India home by 6 wickets. This win marked India’s second Cricket World Cup
    title, 28 years after their first triumph in 1983. The 2011 victory was
    historic not only for the team but also for the nation, as it was Sachin
    Tendulkar’s first World Cup win in his sixth attempt, fulfilling a lifelong
    dream and delighting millions of fans. The tournament inspired a new
    generation of cricketers and strengthened India’s reputation as a dominant
    force in world cricket. It also highlighted the importance of teamwork,
    resilience, and leadership, particularly Dhoni’s calm and strategic
    captaincy, which played a pivotal role in India’s success.
