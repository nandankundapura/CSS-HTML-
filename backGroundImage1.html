          was the third edition of the tournament and took place in England from
          9 June to 25 June 1983. India, led by Kapil Dev, participated as
          underdogs, with few expecting a strong performance. Despite this, the

          aggressive batting to advance through the group stages and the
          knockout rounds. A highlight of the tournament was Kapil Dev’s
          memorable 175-run innings against Zimbabwe, which played a key role in
          keeping India’s campaign alive.
