    <h1>Java Basics</h1>

    <h2>History of Java</h2>
    <p class="history">
      <strong>Java</strong> was developed by <em>James Gosling</em> at Sun
      Microsystems in 1995. It was created to be a
      <b>platform-independent</b>, object-oriented programming language that can
      run on any device using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
    </p>
    <p class="history">
      Java quickly became popular due to its portability, security, and
      robustness. Today, it is used in web applications, mobile apps, enterprise
      software, and more.
    </p>

    <h2>Class</h2>
    <p class="class-info">
      A <strong>class</strong> is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
      It defines properties (variables) and behaviors (methods).
    </p>
    <p class="class-info">
      <em>Example:</em> A class named <b>Car</b> might have properties like
      <i>color</i> and <i>model</i>, and behaviors like <i>drive()</i> and
      <i>stop()</i>.
    </p>

    <h2>Object</h2>
    <p class="object-info">
      An <strong>object</strong> is an instance of a class. It contains actual
      values for the properties and can use the behaviors.
    </p>
    <p class="object-info">
      <em>Example:</em> If <b>Car</b> is the class, then <i>myCar</i> could be
      an object with color “red” and model “Toyota”.
    </p>

    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p class="variables">
      <strong>Variables</strong> are used to store data in a program. Each
      variable has a <em>type</em> which defines what kind of data it can hold.
    </p>
    <p class="variables">
      For example, <i>int number = 5;</i>. Variables allow programs to store,
      change, and use data during execution.
